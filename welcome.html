                <h2>The Life and Work of Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
                
                <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) was an Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having little formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to the field that have influenced mathematics to this day.</p>
                
                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                <p>Born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, India, Ramanujan showed exceptional mathematical talent from an early age. By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students who were lodgers at his home. At age 13, he mastered advanced trigonometry and developed his own theorems.</p>
                
                <h3>Self-Taught Genius</h3>
                <p>Ramanujan's mathematical education was largely self-directed. At age 16, he obtained a copy of "A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics" by G.S. Carr, which contained thousands of mathematical results with little or no proof. This book became the foundation of his mathematical thinking and inspired him to develop his own mathematical ideas.</p>
                
                <h3>Collaboration with G.H. Hardy</h3>
                <p>In 1913, Ramanujan wrote to several Cambridge professors, including G.H. Hardy, sharing some of his mathematical discoveries. Hardy recognized Ramanujan's extraordinary talent and arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. Their collaboration from 1914 to 1919 produced remarkable results, including groundbreaking work on the partition function and the Ramanujan prime.</p>
                
                <h3>Mathematical Contributions</h3>
                <p>Ramanujan's work spans various areas of mathematics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number Theory:</strong> He made significant contributions to the theory of partitions, discovering surprising patterns in the partition function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infinite Series:</strong> He developed numerous infinite series for π and other mathematical constants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Continued Fractions:</strong> He discovered remarkable identities involving continued fractions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mock Theta Functions:</strong> In his final year, he introduced mock theta functions, which remained mysterious until the 21st century.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>Despite his short life—he died at age 32 from illness—Ramanujan left behind three notebooks filled with nearly 3,900 results. Many of these formulas have inspired mathematical research for decades. His birthday, December 22, is celebrated as National Mathematics Day in India, and 2012 was declared the National Mathematical Year in his honor.</p>
                
                <p>Ramanujan's story exemplifies the power of raw mathematical intuition and has inspired generations of mathematicians worldwide. His work continues to be studied and applied in various fields, including physics, computer science, and cryptography.</p>
